1. DTO (Data Transfer Object)
Purpose:
DTOs act as the boundary objects for communication between the external world (e.g., API clients, other services) and your application.
They transfer data between the Application Layer and external systems or clients without exposing internal domain logic.
Usage in Hexagonal Architecture:
Inbound Adapter: DTOs are used in REST controllers, WebSocket endpoints, or message listeners to map incoming requests into application-specific objects.
Outbound Adapter: DTOs are used to send data to external systems like other microservices or third-party APIs.

2. Domain Model
Purpose:
Represents the core business logic and rules, independent of frameworks, persistence, or external concerns.
It is the heart of the hexagonal architecture and exists within the Application Core.
Usage in Hexagonal Architecture:
Application Layer: Domain objects handle use cases and interact with application services.
Ports: Domain models are used when defining interfaces (ports) for input/output operations.
Domain models should be designed to encapsulate business behavior.

3. Entity
Purpose:
Represents the data structure used for persistence and maps to a database table.
Entities are part of the Infrastructure Layer and deal with database-specific concerns.
Usage in Hexagonal Architecture:
Outbound Adapter: Entities are used by repositories to interact with the database.
They should map closely to database tables and may include JPA or other ORM annotations.
The mapping between domain models and entities happens in Outbound Adapters.



How They Interact in Hexagonal Architecture:
1. Inbound Communication:
Controller (Inbound Adapter):
Receives a NewMovieDto from the client.
Converts NewMovieDto to a Domain Model (Movie).
Passes the domain model to an Application Service (use case).
2. Core Business Logic:
Application Core (Domain Layer):
Contains business rules and logic in the Domain Model (Movie).
Defines interfaces (Ports) for persistence or external communication.
3. Outbound Communication:
Repository/Service (Outbound Adapter):
Converts the Domain Model (Movie) to a Persistence Entity (MovieEntity) for database interaction.
Or converts the domain model to an Outbound DTO for external APIs.



Normal Spring Boot Project:
Ideal for simple or small projects.
When speed of development is more important than maintainability.
When the application doesn't need to accommodate frequent changes in infrastructure.


Hexagonal Architecture Spring Boot Project:
Suitable for complex or long-lived projects.
When maintainability, scalability, and testability are critical.
When the application needs to integrate with multiple external systems (or is likely to change technologies in the future).


Core (Innermost Layer):
The core is the heart of the application and contains the business logic. It represents the fundamental rules and processes that define the application's behavior. This layer is independent of external systems and should be kept free from any framework-specific code.

Ports (Interfaces):
Ports define the interfaces or contracts through which the core interacts with the external world. They are essentially the entry and exit points for data and operations in the application. Ports include input ports (for receiving data or commands) and output ports (for sending data, events, or notifications to external systems without knowing their specific implementations).

Adapters (Outer Layers):
Adapters are responsible for implementing the ports defined in the core. They bridge the gap between the core and external systems, translating requests and responses as needed. There are different types of adapters, including:

Input or Primary Adapters or Driven Adapters: These are responsible for receiving input from external sources (e.g., user interfaces, API endpoints) and converting it into a format that the core can understand.

Output or Secondary Adapters or Driving Adapters: These handle communication with external resources like databases, third-party services, or external APIs.

External Systems or Frameworks and Drivers (Outermost Layer):
This layer contains the external systems and frameworks that the application uses. It includes elements like databases, web frameworks, UI libraries, and other external tools. The adapters in this layer facilitate communication between the application and these external systems.
